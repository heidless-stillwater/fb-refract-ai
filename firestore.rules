/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for Image Transformation App.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for images. Each user, identified by their Firebase Authentication UID,
 * has exclusive access to their own image data. Data schema validation is relaxed for prototyping.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All image data is nested under /users/{userId}/images/{imageId}, providing a clear ownership hierarchy.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access and manage images associated with their own UID.
 * - The 'list' operation is restricted to the owner of the images.
 * - Data validation is minimized to essential fields only, focusing on user ID consistency.
 * - Denormalization: The userId is implicitly denormalized via the path.  The image documents under `/users/{userId}` are considered owned by `userId`.

     * @description Enforces access control for images stored under a user's profile.
     * @path /users/{userId}/images/{imageId}
     * @allow (create) - Allows a user to create an image if the userId matches their auth UID and imageId is present in the document.
     * @allow (get, list) - Allows a user to read their own images.
     * @allow (update, delete) - Allows a user to update or delete their own images if they exist.
     * @deny (create) - Denies creation if the userId does not match the auth UID.
     * @deny (update, delete) - Denies updating or deleting images that do not exist or do not belong to the user.
     * @principle Enforces document ownership for writes, restricts access to a user's own data tree, validates relational integrity between documents.
