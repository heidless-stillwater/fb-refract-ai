    "reasoning": "Given the anonymous authentication and the core features of the \"AI Image Hub\" application (Refract AI), the Firestore data structure is designed for simplicity and scalability, focusing on storing transformed images generated by users.  Since there is no authentication, images are stored without explicit user association.\n\nAuthorization Independence is achieved because there are no user-based or role-based access controls. Since users are anonymous, all access is public and determined by rules that prevent abuse and ensure data integrity.  The structure supports the required QAPs because the design is simple. Data is segregated by type and has no complex access rules.\n\nTo ensure security and prevent abuse, security rules should focus on rate limiting and basic input validation (e.g., maximum image size, allowed transformation types)."
